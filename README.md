# PilatusBot

This local radio station of mine has this event thingy where they don't play a song twice from 8AM - 5PM. If you realize a song was already played and call them first... 500 Bucks in your pocket.
What would any sane person do? Sit in front of the radio all day? Nononono. Write a bot that runs 24/7 checks the ICE stream matadata for the current song title and as soon as a song is played for the second time
notify the also custom make phone app to notify you and as soon as you pull your phone from your pocket you realize that you're already connected b.c. the app made the call for you.

Unfortunately the event only happens a few times a year and so far it hasn't happned since I made this. :( I'll be waiting though.
